# Introduction

This repository includes and explains the code used for the [comparative analysis](https://slides.com/piluc/icalp-50?token=fl3BBJ8j) presented at the exhibition on the history of ICALP in Paris, 2022, and for the analysis of the CONCUR conference, the [analysis of the SIROCCO conference](https://slides.com/piluc/sirocco30?token=fDaMD1wY), and the [analysis of the LAGOS conference](http://www.pilucrescenzi.it/miner/examples/lagos/lagos.html).

If you want to start using the code and analysing a conference (included in the DBLP dataset), you can read the [tutorial](https://slides.com/piluc/conferencemining?token=-YK83Rbq), which explains the steps to be done in order to generate a web page describing the data- and graph-mining analysis of the conference (for any question, comment, or error, do not hesitate to contact me). You can the look at the [software documentation](https://pilucrescenzi.it).
